-- Migration 004: Create logos storage bucket with RLS policies

-- Create the public bucket for brand logos
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('logos', 'logos', true);

-- Allow authenticated users to upload logos into their own folder (user_id/)
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own logos"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'logos'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own logos
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own logos"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'logos'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own logos
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own logos"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'logos'
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow public read access (needed for Satori image generation)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for logos"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (bucket_id = 'logos');
